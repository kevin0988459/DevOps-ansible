Pros and Cons with respect to deployment:

Ansible:
Pros: Easy to learn thanks to its use of Python and YAML. No agents required, it leverages SSH for configuration.
      Simple to set up and ideal for small to large deployments. Large and active community for support.
Cons: Limited error handling compared to Chef and Puppet.

Chef:
Pros: Offers flexibility and infrastructure as code capabilities.
      Chef cookbooks define the desired state of a system, allowing for modular and reusable configurations. Large and active community.
Cons: Requires knowledge of Ruby for deeper configuration. Setting up Chef can be more complex compared to Ansible.

Puppet:
Pros: Mature tool known for security and excellent at handling large deployments. Similar to Chef, Puppet uses modules for reusability. Large and active community.
Cons: Requires knowledge of the Puppet DSL, which can have a steeper learning curve. Setting up Puppet can be complex.

Equivalents to Ansible Playbooks
Ansible playbooks outline the desired configuration state for a system or group of systems. Here's how Chef and Puppet achieve similar outcomes:

Chef: Chef cookbooks define the desired state using a collection of recipes. Each recipe focuses on a specific configuration aspect. Multiple cookbooks can be combined to create complex deployments.

Puppet: Puppet manifests are written in the Puppet DSL and specify the desired state for resources on a system. Similar to playbooks, manifests can be organized into modules for reusability.
